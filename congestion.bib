@article{Christodoulou2005,
abstract = {We consider the price of anarchy of pure Nash equilibria in congestion games with linear latency functions. For asymmetric games, the price of anarchy of maximum social cost is $\Theta$(N), where N is the number of players. For all other cases of symmetric or asymmetric games and for both maximum and average social cost, the price of anarchy is 5/2. We extend the results to latency functions that are polynomials of bounded degree. We also extend some of the results to mixed Nash equilibria.},

@article{Rieger2008,
abstract = {We extend the original form of prospect theory by Kahneman and Tversky from finite lotteries to arbitrary probability distributions, using an approximation method based on weak-? convergence. The resulting formula is computationally easier than the corresponding formula for cumulative prospect theory and makes it possible to use prospect theory in future ap- plications in economics and finance. Moreover, we suggest a method how to incorporate a crucial step of the “editing phase” into prospect theory and to remove in this way the discontinuity of the originalmodel. Keywords},
