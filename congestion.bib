abstract = {We consider the price of anarchy of pure Nash equilibria in congestion games with linear latency functions. For asymmetric games, the price of anarchy of maximum social cost is $\Theta$(N), where N is the number of players. For all other cases of symmetric or asymmetric games and for both maximum and average social cost, the price of anarchy is 5/2. We extend the results to latency functions that are polynomials of bounded degree. We also extend some of the results to mixed Nash equilibria.},

The resulting formula is computationally easier than the corresponding formula for cumulative prospect theory and makes it possible to use prospect theory in future ap- plications in economics and finance. Moreover, we suggest a method how to incorporate a crucial step of the “editing phase” into prospect theory and to remove in this way the discontinuity of the originalmodel. Keywords},

@article{Roughgarden2012,
abstract = {The price of anarchy (POA) is a worst-case measure of the inefficiency of selfish behavior, defined as the ratio of the objective function value of a worst Nash equilibrium of a game and that of an optimal outcome. This measure implicitly assumes that players successfully reach some Nash equilibrium. This drawback motivates the search for inefficiency bounds that apply more generally to weaker notions of equilibria, such as mixed Nash and correlated equilibria; or to sequences of outcomes generated by natural experimentation strategies, such as successive best responses or simultaneous regret-minimization. We prove a general and fundamental connection between the price of anarchy and its seemingly stronger relatives in classes of games with a sum objective. First, we identify a "canonical sufficient condition" for an upper bound of the POA for pure Nash equilibria, which we call a smoothness argument . Second, we show that every bound derived via a smoothness argument extends automatically , with no quantitative degradation in the bound, to mixed Nash equilibria, correlated equilibria, and the average objective function value of regret-minimizing players (or "price of total anarchy"). Smoothness arguments also have automatic implications for the inefficiency of approximate and Bayesian-Nash equilibria and, under mild additional assumptions, for bicriteria bounds and for polynomial-length best-response sequences. We also identify classes of games most notably, congestion games with cost functions restricted to an arbitrary fixed set that are tight , in the sense that smoothness arguments are guaranteed to produce an optimal worst-case upper bound on the POA, even for the smallest set of interest (pure Nash equilibria). Byproducts of our proof of this result include the first tight bounds on the POA in congestion games with non-polynomial cost functions, and the first structural characterization of atomic congestion games that are universal worst-case examples for the POA.},

@article{Koutsoupias2009,
abstract = {In a system where noncooperative agents share a common resource, we propose the price of anarchy, which is the ratio between the worst possible Nash equilibrium and the social optimum, as a measure of the effectiveness of the system. Deriving upper and lower bounds for this ratio in a model where several agents share a very simple network leads to some interesting mathematics, results, and open problems.22The conference version of this work [Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou (1999) [17]] appeared a decade ago and it has been followed by a large amount of work on the concept of the price of anarchy (as witnessed by the extensive coverage in Nisan et al. (2007) [9]). In this journal version we tried to keep as much as possible the text of the original paper. There are, though, important changes because results that were substantially improved in the meantime are omitted. The other notable change is that here we use the term "price of anarchy" instead of the original term "coordination ratio". The use of the latter term faded away in the literature, being replaced by the term "price of anarchy" which was first introduced in Papadimitriou (2001) [18]. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.
